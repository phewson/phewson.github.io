      <description>Nowadays, we rarely ask the question &amp;ldquo;do we have data&amp;rdquo;. Often we have lots of data and the first barrier we hit may force us to instead ask &amp;ldquo;do we have the right data?&amp;rdquo; Even when the answer to this question is NO, we often need to be able to do the best we can with the available data. It has become so easy to collect vast quantities of electronic data as a byproduct of other processes that we expect data to be on tap and free.</description>

      <description>There are two key things to say about modern Data Science.
Continuous Improvement / Continuous Delivery The first concerns &amp;ldquo;Continous Integration/Continuous Delivery&amp;rdquo; (CI/CD); a modern software development practice. The advantages of scripted analyses (reproducibility, testing, auditability) are well established; it&amp;rsquo;s a small leap to seeing these scripts as simple pieces of software and realising they need their entire architecture specified and tested continuously. Indeed I have published in Annals of Operations Research on the pitfalls of spreadsheets for data analysis.</description>

      <title>GB Road Fatalities and Life Expectancy</title>
      <link>/posts/2020-09-07-road_fatalities_life_expectancy/</link>

      <guid>/posts/2020-09-07-road_fatalities_life_expectancy/</guid>
      <description>In total, over the four decades for which we have data (1979-2018), 147,562 fatalities have been reported to the police. Whilst it is the case that the number of reported fatalities has reduced considerably:
 In 2018, 1,784 fatalities were reported. This still feels like a substantial tragedy and many argue there is considerable potential to reduce this much further if we took the decisions (such as limiting urban speeds) to make roads safer.</description>

      <title>Configuration management</title>

      <description>One thing I have learnt is configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s an under-rated aspect of reproducible research. I was quickly experimenting with an R package, but needed to install the sf package on my tinkering machine. That in turn required another R package units. And in turn, units needed some header files, as did sf. As it turns out, units package failed with a very nice error message telling me exactly what I had to do.</description>

      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve been droning on about for a few years concerns our reluctance to use datasets that already exist.
  Specifically in relation to cycling, we have a lot of data on cycling that is rarely used, and that&amp;rsquo;s without worrying about data that aren&amp;rsquo;t disseminated in a way that lets us use it. Here are some high quality UK based data sources. These come from surveys that are very expensive to conduct:</description>

Legislation which carries large fines usually provides a good reason for checking out the law. In this case, the driver is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU directive which addresses the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. Natural persons are &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; people, unlike llegal persons which includes entities like companies. It asserts that natural persons have the right to have their personal data personal data protected.</description>

      <title>Static Websites with Hugo and R-Blogdown</title>

      <description>The current iteration of this website is a static website based on Hugo. In my opinion, there is a lot to like about static websites. I have previously used Jekyll and once upon a time coded html manually. However, modern static website generators allow a wonderful presentation. The currently styling is based upon the Terrassa theme; for me it scored highly for accessibility and mobile friendliness. The bigger issue for me though is to do data and version controlling.</description>

      <title>Reported Road Injuries in GB</title>

      <description>In the event of a road collision involving at least one vehicle and one injury, there is a requirement in the UK to report to the police within 30 days. The data are called “STATs19” after the form on which the data are collected, and are made available as “Open Data” for anyone to analyse.
This immediately raises a number of points:
What is a “road” collision (do car parks, driveways, private roads count)?</description>

Having worked as an academic, as a Data Scientist, as a Business Intelligence Specialist as well as doing a lot of consulting I have learnt a lot about the way we use data, and the way people perceive &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; (whatever that word really means).
Sometimes, a problem is so straightforward it only requires technical input (data processing) and it&amp;rsquo;s solved. More often though, a lot more interpretation is needed.</description>

      <title>COVID: Mathematical models and statistical models</title>

      <description>One thing the COVID-19 pandemic has achieved is an incredible and widespread interest in numerical descriptions of the outbreak. You can’t go far on social media without encountering an armchair expert on R numbers. Sometimes they call them R-nought but I’m sure they mean R(t). Now we can find errors in their understanding and scoff, or we can use this as an educational opportunity. People are now interested in data, but they are also interested in models.</description>

      <description>I suppose I started thinking about this really hard in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m not sure it’s something we articulate well; the difference between a mathematical model. A mathematical model is meant to capture the science of a phenomenon in mathematical terms. A statistical model is meant to “fit” data and account for the uncertainty; but doesn’t necessarily explain the science. And there are certainly plenty of examples where you’re fitting a statistical model to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model.</description>

      <description>A small trebuchet in action
This Trebuchet is a bit puny compared to the one at Warwick Castle. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating piece of engineering, and certainly makes a bit of a difference from doing bisections with a compass. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I selected this as &amp;ldquo;the right tech&amp;rdquo; to use in school outreach work.
This is old work now, but I learnt a lot getting involved in it.</description>
