&lt;p>This was a &lt;strong>cold&lt;/strong> paddle, with a little bit of wind coming from the North. We started off as a single group with two paddlers on their first Saturday paddle. At Fort Picklecombe, the leader decided to split us into two groups; one going to Mount Edgcumbe for lunch and the other to Cawsand. As it turned out, we went a little beyond Penlee point and had lunch at a beach (Sandway&amp;rsquo;s beach?) before returning home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Penlee Point and Cawsand</title><link>/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/PENLEE.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was an interesting day, sandwiched between outburts of Storm Ã‰owyn saw very little wind, but some large low frequency swell. My weather API suggested 2m; it was hard to believe it was that big. However, it was low frequency, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get far enough away from anyone to &amp;ldquo;calibrate&amp;rdquo; my call on this. Indeed, we managed to paddle across the sound outside the breakwater.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Totnes to Kingswear</title><link>/kayaking/2025-01-04_totnes_kingswear/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2025-01-04_totnes_kingswear/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2025-01-04_totnes_kingswear/map.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>It took about 90 minutes to arrange the car shuffle; most cars parked in Kingswear with the bare minimum returning to Totnes. We embarked from Longmarsh Car Park and followed the tide down the river. Weather was extremely cold, and it was a little windy, especially turning after Dittisham where the Dart widens out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountbatten to Wembury</title><link>/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/group.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was a cold, dark and very flat day. Nice paddle though. Over 12 miles. Did some rock hopping in unchallenging conditions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meadfoot Guinea Pig</title><link>/kayaking/2024-11-02_meadfoot_guinea_pig/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2024-11-02_meadfoot_guinea_pig/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2024-11-02_meadfoot_guinea_pig/floating.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>I volunteered to act as a &amp;ldquo;Guinea Pig&amp;rdquo; for a young instructor taking his Sea Kayak Leader award. The nice thing here is that I &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to fall in the water, so there&amp;rsquo;s no shame if it happens. The plan had been to paddle from Salcombe, but that was rearranged.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maidencombe Paddle</title><link>/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/screenshot.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was a short but challenging paddle from Teignmouth to Maidencombe. I think the plan had been to stop in for coffee and then move on to Babbacombe for lunch, but there was a fair bit of swell. Andy Benham suggested it was closer to 1m than the 0.8 shown on my forecast.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
