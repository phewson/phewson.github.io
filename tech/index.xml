      <description>The current iteration of this website is a static website based on Hugo. In my opinion, there is a lot to like about static websites. I have previously used Jekyll and once upon a time coded html manually. However, modern static website generators allow a wonderful presentation. The currently styling is based upon the Terrassa theme; for me it scored highly for accessibility and mobile friendliness. The bigger issue for me though is to do data and version controlling.</description>

      <description>This is old work now, but I learnt a lot getting involved in it. We seem to have designed a school curriculum with the sole intended outcome of putting students off statistics for life. I assume that wasn&amp;rsquo;t done on purpose, but that is the effect. There seems to be a particular emphasis on teaching things that are easily assessed (can you do this calculation) and no real exploration of meaning.</description>
