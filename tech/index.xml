      <description>One thing I have learnt is configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s an under-rated aspect of reproducible research. I was quickly experimenting with an R package, but needed to install the sf package on my tinkering machine. That in turn required another R package units. And in turn, units needed some header files, as did sf. As it turns out, units package failed with a very nice error message telling me exactly what I had to do.</description>

      <title>Static Websites with Hugo and R-Blogdown</title>

      <description>The current iteration of this website is a static website based on Hugo. In my opinion, there is a lot to like about static websites. I have previously used Jekyll and once upon a time coded html manually. However, modern static website generators allow a wonderful presentation. The currently styling is based upon the Terrassa theme; for me it scored highly for accessibility and mobile friendliness. The bigger issue for me though is to do data and version controlling.</description>

      <description>A small trebuchet in action
This Trebuchet is a bit puny compared to the one at Warwick Castle. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating piece of engineering, and certainly makes a bit of a difference from doing bisections with a compass. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I selected this as &amp;ldquo;the right tech&amp;rdquo; to use in school outreach work.
This is old work now, but I learnt a lot getting involved in it.</description>
