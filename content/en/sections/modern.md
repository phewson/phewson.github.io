Modern Data Science requires a modern IT environment. However, it also requires an up to date knowledge of what is possible in statistical science. The field of statistical science is being advanced just as rapidly as any other science. Many statistics courses are based on techniques which were invented before 1930, and training has not been updated. Given the availability of powerful computers, convenient analytical methods are no longer needed to approximate a solution. We can look for the right solution, if we allow a little computer time. Given the price of computer time, this rarely seems like a barrier to using the best methods avvailable.
