The question nowadays is not "do we have data". Often the first question is "do we have the right data?"   Even if the answer to this question is "NO", we often need to be able to do the best we can to answer the question "what insights can we gain from this answer"?

(I would have used the acronym **AI** for **A**ctionable **I**nsight but that acronym has been taken)
