Domestic consumption is based on Non-Half Hourly (NHH) meters with profiles 1 and 2 (these are the standard domestic and economy 7 tariffs respectively). Non-domestic consumption is based on NHH meters with profiles 3 to 8 and all Half-Hourly meters. In addition, profile 1 and 2 meters are re-allocated to the non-domestic sector if their annual consumption is greater than 100,000 kWh; or if their annual consumption is greater than 50,000 kWh and the address information for meter suggests that it is non-domestic. There are some data quality issues documented in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regional-energy-data-guidance-note">Subnational methodology and guidance&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
