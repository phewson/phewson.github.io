I’m not sure it’s something we articulate well; the difference between a mathematical model. A mathematical model is meant to capture the science of a phenomenon in mathematical terms. A statistical model is meant to “fit” data and account for the uncertainty; but doesn’t necessarily explain the science. And there are certainly plenty of examples where you’re fitting a statistical model to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model. There’s a brilliant article from 2019 in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11865-8">Nature Communications&lt;/a> which sets out the arguments in an advanced form. Here, I’m going to attempt to set out what I think are the key issues using more accessible (if slightly artificial) examples.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
