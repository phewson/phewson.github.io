I do have one little problem with sqitch. I am so used to typing a letter u after a letter q that I regularly mistype the command as squitch, and then end up staring at the terminal for so long I wonder if I should have typed sqint. Very minor naming issues aside, the project has a website at www.sqitch.org. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it a simple and specific database migration tool which does as much as I want and no more.</description>
