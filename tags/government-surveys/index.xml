      <description>One bugbear of mine is that we have a lot of data on cycling, but never use it. In the UK, we have:
 Travel to work data (Census, 2011). National Travel Survey (Ongoing and updated regularly) Active Lives Survey / Active People Survey (Ongoing and updated regularly) Other official surveys ask for information on cycling (this blog is really a placeholder for me to continue to list these). Local government has a lot of cycle loops in a lot of places, but seemingly there is no standard way to expose these on API to anyone who might be interested.</description>
