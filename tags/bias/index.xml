&lt;p>In 1960, &lt;a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf">Eugene Wigner&lt;/a> published &amp;ldquo;The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&amp;rdquo;. Many commentators have indeed agreed it is surprising how relatively simple maths can indeed model so much of the natural world. Wigner argued that modelling a given scientific theory can lead to further advances in the theory. He also claimed success in that a mathematical model can make predictions which allow the theory to be empirically tested. Playing on the title of this paper, in 2009, researchers at
&lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf">Google&lt;/a>
presented &amp;ldquo;The unreasonable effectiveness of data&amp;rdquo;. This is often quoted by tech-evangelists and used to support the idea that &amp;ldquo;building models is expensive, training data is cheap&amp;rdquo;. I would argue it is not quite that simple.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
