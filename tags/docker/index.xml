      <description>I had partitioned my development environment such that I had virtual machines providing:
R and R-studio A PostgreSQL server A development machine This basically avoided some package clashes when &amp;ldquo;tinkering&amp;rdquo;. There is however some clumsiness (I need lots of PostgreSQL clients all over the place). So the current cunning plan is to run some of this inside Docker.
The first step was adding a GPG key and the docker repositories. I seemed to faff around a bit but I think you just sudo apt-get install docker-ce (I think I tried to install too many small parts, and had to add facilities to enable docker compose up and could have avoided all this if I&amp;rsquo;d just installed docker-ce).</description>
