I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend I had read Rebecca Thomson&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Bankruptcy, prosecution and disrupted livelihoods â€“ postmasters tell their story&amp;rdquo; in May 2009 in Computer Weekly, but certainly through journalism such as Private Eye I was aware well before the ITV drama screened in 2024.

I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into an appraisal of her credibility or her competence, other than to wonder how much media coverage you can dismiss and still do your job.</description>
