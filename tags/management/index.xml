&lt;p>Having worked in various Agile and Waterfall environments I have become fascinated by the potential mismatch between Data Modelling and Agile. Searching for some discussion pieces on this, I found an interesting post that reviews a conference discussion. Ultimately, this dates from &lt;a href="https://www.dataversity.net/fundamentals-of-data-modeling-in-agile-environments/">Enterprise Data World 2015&lt;/a>, but does seem to draw on a lot of expertise from enterprise level people who have had to reconcile Data Modelling and Agile. One of the statements made was that under Agile development: &amp;ldquo;There are numerous distinctions between the objectives, approaches, and needs of developers and data modelers that provide various points of conflict&amp;rdquo;. There is some exploration of the experience of various speakers with these conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
