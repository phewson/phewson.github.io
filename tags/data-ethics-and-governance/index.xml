I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend I had read Rebecca Thomson&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Bankruptcy, prosecution and disrupted livelihoods â€“ postmasters tell their story&amp;rdquo; in May 2009 in Computer Weekly, but certainly through journalism such as Private Eye I was aware well before the ITV drama screened in 2024.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about how Differential Privacy is the answer to all our privacy concerns. However, having probed the methodology in detail, I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Indeed, I think we have a silo problem. Differential Privacy has been developed in a Computer Science framework as a means of balancing the need for altering data to meet privacy requirements with the need to maintain data close enough to their raw state to yield meaningful answers.</description>
