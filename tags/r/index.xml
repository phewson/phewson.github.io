      <description>I had partitioned my development environment such that I had virtual machines providing:
 R and R-studio A PostgreSQL server A development machine  This basically avoided some package clashes when &amp;ldquo;tinkering&amp;rdquo;. There is however some clumsiness (I need lots of PostgreSQL clients all over the place). So the current cunning plan is to run some of this inside Docker.

      <description>The current iteration of this website is a static website based on Hugo. In my opinion, there is a lot to like about static websites.

The currently styling is based upon the Terrassa theme; for me it scored highly for accessibility and mobile friendliness. The bigger issue for me though is to do data and version controlling.</description>
