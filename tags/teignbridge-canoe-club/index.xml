&lt;p>It took about 90 minutes to arrange the car shuffle; most cars parked in Kingswear with the bare minimum returning to Totnes. We embarked from Longmarsh Car Park and followed the tide down the river. Weather was extremely cold, and it was a little windy, especially turning after Dittisham where the Dart widens out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maidencombe Paddle</title><link>/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2024-10-12_maidencombe/screenshot.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was a short but challenging paddle from Teignmouth to Maidencombe. I think the plan had been to stop in for coffee and then move on to Babbacombe for lunch, but there was a fair bit of swell. Andy Benham suggested it was closer to 1m than the 0.8 shown on my forecast.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
