&lt;p>This was a &lt;strong>cold&lt;/strong> paddle, with a little bit of wind coming from the North. We started off as a single group with two paddlers on their first Saturday paddle. At Fort Picklecombe, the leader decided to split us into two groups; one going to Mount Edgcumbe for lunch and the other to Cawsand. As it turned out, we went a little beyond Penlee point and had lunch at a beach (Sandway&amp;rsquo;s beach?) before returning home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Penlee Point and Cawsand</title><link>/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2025-01-25_penlee_cawsand/PENLEE.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was an interesting day, sandwiched between outburts of Storm Ã‰owyn saw very little wind, but some large low frequency swell. My weather API suggested 2m; it was hard to believe it was that big. However, it was low frequency, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get far enough away from anyone to &amp;ldquo;calibrate&amp;rdquo; my call on this. Indeed, we managed to paddle across the sound outside the breakwater.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountbatten to Wembury</title><link>/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 10:00:24 +0100</pubDate><author>paul@insightsforaction.uk (Paul Hewson)</author><guid>/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/en/kayaking/2024-12-28_mb_wembury/group.jpg" alt="Data Controller image">

&lt;p>This was a cold, dark and very flat day. Nice paddle though. Over 12 miles. Did some rock hopping in unchallenging conditions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
