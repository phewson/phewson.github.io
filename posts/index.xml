      <description>Data have been obtained from Department of Energy Security and Net Zero Electricity data is divided between domestic and non-domestic categories according to the meter’s profile class. Domestic consumption is based on Non-Half Hourly (NHH) meters with profiles 1 and 2 (these are the standard domestic and economy 7 tariffs respectively). Non-domestic consumption is based on NHH meters with profiles 3 to 8 and all Half-Hourly meters. In addition, profile 1 and 2 meters are re-allocated to the non-domestic sector if their annual consumption is greater than 100,000 kWh; or if their annual consumption is greater than 50,000 kWh and the address information for meter suggests that it is non-domestic.</description>

      <title>Reflections on the Post Office Horizon Enquiry</title>

I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend I had read Rebecca Thomson&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Bankruptcy, prosecution and disrupted livelihoods – postmasters tell their story&amp;rdquo; in May 2009 in Computer Weekly, but certainly through journalism such as Private Eye I was aware well before the ITV drama screened in 2024.
Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m most surprised by the evidence presented by Paula Vennells at the Statuary Inquiry on May 22nd. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into an appraisal of her credibility or her competence, other than to wonder how much media coverage you can dismiss and still do your job.</description>

      <title>Data Privacy; Disclosure control and differential privacy</title>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about how Differential Privacy is the answer to all our privacy concerns. However, having probed the methodology in detail, I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Indeed, I think we have a silo problem. Differential Privacy has been developed in a Computer Science framework as a means of balancing the need for altering data to meet privacy requirements with the need to maintain data close enough to their raw state to yield meaningful answers.</description>

      <description>It’s been taking a little longer than I’d wanted to collate estimates of cycle activity based on the National Travel Survey, partly because there are big gaps in the 70s and 80s before it became a continuous survey, and partly because it is a complex survey.
In the meantime, I’ve produced a “simple” time series plot of the total number of serious and fatal cycle casualties reported to the police from 1979 to 2019.</description>

      <title>Developing context; the value of historical data</title>
      <link>https://insightsforaction.uk/posts/2021-01-06_age_period_cohort/</link>

      <description>I believe that data makes little sense without context. Often, we are lacking adequate information on context. When researching disease, knowing the age and sex of the patients is almost always important. When considering road injury research, it is harder to arrive at such an understanding because firstly there are both drivers and casualties to consider, and secondly there may be more than one driver. One of the most substantial weaknesses in the official road safety collision data are that no information is collected on uninjured passengers in any of the vehicles involved.</description>

      <title>Unreasonable effectiveness of data</title>

In 1960, Eugene Wigner published &amp;ldquo;The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&amp;rdquo;. Many commentators have indeed agreed it is surprising how relatively simple maths can indeed model so much of the natural world. Wigner argued that modelling a given scientific theory can lead to further advances in the theory. He also claimed success in that a mathematical model can make predictions which allow the theory to be empirically tested.</description>

      <title>GB Road Fatalities and Life Expectancy</title>

      <description>In total, over the four decades for which we have data (1979-2018), 147,562 fatalities have been reported to the police. Whilst it is the case that the number of reported fatalities has reduced considerably:
In 2018, 1,784 fatalities were reported. This still feels like a substantial tragedy and many argue there is considerable potential to reduce this much further if we took the decisions (such as limiting urban speeds) to make roads safer.</description>

      <title>Data Sources and Cycling</title>

      <description>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve been droning on about for a few years concerns our reluctance to use datasets that already exist.
Specifically in relation to cycling, we have a lot of data on cycling that is rarely used, and that&amp;rsquo;s without worrying about data that aren&amp;rsquo;t disseminated in a way that lets us use it. Here are some high quality UK based data sources. These come from surveys that are very expensive to conduct:</description>

Legislation which carries large fines usually provides a good reason for checking out the law. In this case, the driver is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU directive which addresses the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. Natural persons are &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; people, unlike llegal persons which includes entities like companies. It asserts that natural persons have the right to have their personal data personal data protected.</description>

      <title>Reported Road Injuries in GB</title>
      <link>https://insightsforaction.uk/posts/2020-08-07-stats19overview/</link>

      <description>In the event of a road collision involving at least one vehicle and one injury, there is a requirement in the UK to report to the police within 30 days. The data are called “STATs19” after the form on which the data are collected, and are made available as “Open Data” for anyone to analyse.
This immediately raises a number of points:
What is a “road” collision (do car parks, driveways, private roads count)?</description>

Having worked as an academic, as a Data Scientist, as a Business Intelligence Specialist as well as doing a lot of consulting I have learnt a lot about the way we use data, and the way people perceive &amp;ldquo;statistics&amp;rdquo; (whatever that word really means).
Sometimes, a problem is so straightforward it only requires technical input (data processing) and it&amp;rsquo;s solved. More often though, a lot more interpretation is needed.</description>

      <description>I suppose I started thinking about this really hard in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m not sure it’s something we articulate well; the difference between a mathematical model. A mathematical model is meant to capture the science of a phenomenon in mathematical terms. A statistical model is meant to “fit” data and account for the uncertainty; but doesn’t necessarily explain the science. And there are certainly plenty of examples where you’re fitting a statistical model to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model.</description>
